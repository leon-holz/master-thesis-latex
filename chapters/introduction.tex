\chapter{Introduction}
Reddit is a social media platform where users engage in discussions across various subreddits—dedicated communities focused on specific topics. 
Posts within a subreddit can receive upvotes and downvotes, determining their visibility. 
Meanwhile, karma serves as a numerical representation of a user's contributions through posts and comments, functioning similarly to likes on other social media platforms.

Reddit has over 365 million active weekly users~\cite{redditinc}, with about 70\% of users in the U.S. reportedly using it as their primary news source~\cite{pewresearch}. 
Politicians, including Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Bernie Sanders, have recognized Reddit’s influence by hosting \textit{Ask Me Anything} (AMA) sessions~\cite{deaton2017using}.

The ability to predict the popularity of online content has significant implications for marketing, content optimization, and social media engagement strategies. 
Companies invest heavily in predictive systems to maximize visibility and audience engagement~\cite{deaton2017using}. 
However, prior studies on online content popularity often focus on other platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, or rely on limited feature sets that overlook subreddit-specific dynamics. 

Moreover, predictive models for content popularity raise ethical concerns. 
The ability to manipulate a post’s visibility could be exploited for misinformation campaigns, artificially amplifying certain narratives under the guise of community approval~\cite{deaton2017using}. Understanding the underlying factors that drive Reddit post popularity is therefore essential, both for refining predictive models and for mitigating potential risks.

This study leverages a neural network model using text embeddings and numerical features, such as author karma and account age, to predict post popularity. 
We analyze how subreddit-specific characteristics impact predictive performance, revealing key challenges in generalizing across different communities.
Our findings contribute to the broader understanding of engagement patterns on Reddit and highlight potential strategies for improving predictive accuracy while addressing biases in content visibility.
