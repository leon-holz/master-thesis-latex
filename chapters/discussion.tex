\section{Learning/Limitation}

using chat gpt helped with smaller code fragments alot, but left much to be desired for more complex and large code systems
% maybe elaborate (limited context length led to forgetting relevant code pieces or other specifications)
% specifically for training models where additional or different inputs are relevant 

training model consistency: sometimes hard to gauge how much model improves when certain randomness and noise is introduced during training, causing performance deviations that are not attributed to the "improvements"

GPU histogram building and multi-threading can introduce tiny numeric drift, and you’re using stochastic subsampling
+ early stopping in combination with the above.

therefore decided to use no multithreading and set other specific options to keep it as consistent and deterministic as possible
