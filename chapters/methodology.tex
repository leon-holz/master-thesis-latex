TODO kleine einleitung



\section{Dataset}

Firstly, a large dataset of Reddit posts is required for our study. 
Initially, we planned to collect data using the Reddit API through the PRAW library~\cite{praw}, as it allows us to select specific subreddits freely. 
However, the API imposes a limitation of retrieving only 1,000 posts per request. 
Reddit offers different sorting options, such as hot, new, rising, top, and controversial, which can be combined to increase the diversity of the dataset. 
In theory, this approach could yield up to 5,000 unique posts per subreddit. 
However, in practice, many posts appear in multiple categories, significantly reducing the actual number of unique posts collected—typically to around 2,000 per subreddit. 

volume far too small for training model or making claims using this small subset for millions of posts, necessitating an alternative approach to data collection.

instead of using the api, we used datasets provided by pushshift~\cite{baumgartner2020pushshiftredditdataset}

Pushshift is a large-scale data collection and archiving project that provides historical and near real-time access to social media data, most notably from Reddit. It was developed and maintained by Jason Baumgartner with the goal of facilitating social science research, data mining, and natural language processing (NLP) applications.

Pushshift continuously ingested Reddit data via the platform’s public API and other data sources, archiving submissions and comments in a structured and queryable format. The data were made publicly accessible through two main interfaces:

The Pushshift API, which allowed users to query Reddit submissions and comments by a wide range of metadata (e.g., subreddit, author, score, creation time, etc.), often returning results faster and with fewer limitations than the official Reddit API.

Public data dumps, periodically released as compressed JSON files, providing bulk access to large portions of Reddit’s history for offline processing.

Because of its extensive temporal coverage, Pushshift became a foundational resource in computational social science, linguistics, and political discourse analysis. Researchers used it to study online behavior, polarization, community dynamics, and the diffusion of information across subreddits and time.

However, as of 2023, Pushshift’s public API was restricted following policy changes and concerns from Reddit regarding data use and privacy. While historical datasets remain accessible through archives and mirrors, real-time access has become limited. Consequently, many researchers now rely on the official Reddit API (via tools such as PRAW) or third-party mirrors of Pushshift’s data for updated collections.

therefore only data up to 2023 is available. also must be mindful of potential biases, such as incomplete coverage, post-deletion timing discrepancies, or missing metadata in later versions of the dataset.

we found that alot of the time the scores noted in the pushshift datasets were slightly off compared to results from the reddit api via praw. this could be due to upvote fuzzing or additional user engagement after the post and its data was saved to pushshift 
upvote fuzzing adds a random constant to upvotes and downvotes in order to ``combat spam and manipulation''. this behavior was supposedly stopped 2018 \cite{stoddard2015popularity}

also there is additional data that was required for analysis and later model training, so we used the reddit api via praw to gather additonal data for each post and all authors contained in it

also information for some posts could not be retrieved via the reddit api because they haeve since been removed, either by author, subreddit moderators or reddit admins, or the Id might not be correct in pushshift
therefore those posts were filtered out
additionally there were other posts where the user or the post have been banned or deleted, causing the content to not be available anymore. those posts have been filtered too
-> possible introduction of bias against controversial or unpopular content
Posts where author data could not be retrieved due to API limitations or other reasons were also excluded.

\section{Subreddit used}

for subreddits, since we wanted to see differences and similiaries in the different political landscapes, we chose to pick 5 subreddits of each leaning, meaning left, right, and neutral. Additonally, to have a point of comparison, we chose to also include 5 subreddits that are not inherently political, so that we can see how posts from these subreddits are different to the ones from political subreddits


generel metrics included the size of the sub, what post types they usually use 
for our analysis, we tried to get subreddit with little images and mostly selftext and link posts, 
we also tried to find subreddits that were "large enough" after filtering posts under a minimum of either a score of 3 or amount of comments equal to 3

we chose to use keep analysis to 20 subreddits with medium size because of resources used for the encoded datasets. As subreddit as large as relationship\_advice for example would take up as much as 20GB using a fairly small dimensional encoder of 1024 dimensions. 
Ofcourse such size comes with longer encoding and model training time. WIth our approach each subreddit takes up between 0.15GB and 4GB after being encoded and enables us to test more configurations in the same time. 
additionally we assumed it was likely that we would try different encoders or prompts which would add even more storage required

to find out which direction a subreddit leans, we decided to use a mixture of the subreddits own descriptions and the work of Waller et al. \cite{waller2021quantifying}, which aligned for the subreddits we analyzed, if the description allowed for clear alignment.
in the following x you can see the subreedits chosen, their community title and description and comments on why they were chosen

Initially we also wanted to include infamous and controversial subreddits such as r/The\_Donald, r/Mr\_Trump, r/uncensorednews or r/new\_right. Unfortunately, these subreddit were all banned or quarantined, meaning you can no longer gather data about them via praw.
There were also a few subreddits which were too small after filtering out deleted posts and posts with low engagement

% todo test keeping low engagement in as unpopular posts

% todo mentioned subreddits that i decided against later for reasons like low post amount or other stuff

as mentioned earlier, we filtered out deleted or removed posts/users. Here we found that left, right and apolitical leaning were relatively close with 16.5 - 20\% deleted posts. Neutral leaning however had more than half removed.

\section{Explorative Analysis}

in this chapter we explore the datasets, gathering general statistics in regards to the subreddit as well as a more detailed look into the dataset using sentiment analysis, tfidf, embedding analysis as well as analyzing domains used in link posts


\subsection{}{Basic Information}

analyzed content types per subreddit
since goal is to create posts via gen ai later and use our model to predict if they will be popular, we focused on link and selftext posts
as we can see in \autoref{fig:post_content_type_distribution}, most politcal subreddits have an overwhelming amount of link posts, a small amount of images and video posts, that does not exceed 25\% when added together and a varying amount of selftext posts. 

\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/content_type_distribution.png}
    \caption{Post Content Type Distribution per Subreddit}
    \label{fig:post_content_type_distribution}
\end{figure}


analyzed posts made per year by subreddit in \autoref{fig:posting_volume_per_year}
no clear trend for all subreddit, some appear to rise throughtout the years, some spike and fall of again, some seem to decline. One has to note that depending on the subreddit, a good of amount of posts had to be filtered out. its unclear, where those posts would fall into
\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/posting_volume_yearly.png}
    \caption{Posting Volume per year}
    \label{fig:posting_volume_per_year}
\end{figure}

next we looked at the score distribution in \autoref{fig:score_distribution}
here we can see that the largest amount of posts are between a score of 1 to 10 and 11-100 respectively, note that a score of 100 as an example might be reached with a upvote ratio of 55\%, meaning its not necessarily a popular post
taking account \autoref{fig:score_statistics_over_time}, we can see that although the amount of posting every year did not have a clear trend (\autoref{fig:posting_volume_per_year}), the score seems to increase or roughly stay the same for most subreddits

\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/score_distribution.png}
    \caption{Score Distribution}
    \label{fig:score_distribution}

    \caption{Score Stastistics over Time}
    \label{fig:score_statistics_over_time}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Sentiment}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/sentiment_analysis.png}
    \caption{Analyzing Sentiment per Subreddit over time}
    \label{fig:sentiment}
\end{figure}

% todo compare popular vs unpopular and such


\subsection{TFIDF}

used tfidf on subreddits
added reddit/subreddit specific terms as custom stopwords


% top terms

terms such as state, republican, american, political, democrat, president, government were relevant throughout and were not included in above
we aggregated the tfidf scores and set a minimum of 5 subreddits that the term should be included in


top terms across subreddits per timespans:
2008-2010: obama, health/obama care
2010-2012: obama, paul, debt, tax
2012-2014: obama, paul romney, war, gun, tax, obamacare
2014-2016: obama, gun, war, hillary clinton, trump
2016-2018: (donald) trump, hillary clinton, obama, bernie sanders
2018-2020: trump, president, democrats, tax, war, free
2020-2022: biden, trump, covid, coronavirus, joe, police

% distintive words

ignoring words that are very specific to the subreddit such as "liberal" for liberal or "conservative" for conservative subreddit or very broad terms such as america, white house, president, conservative, democratic and such

done by calculating the uniqueness: difference between tfidf score of term in subreddit and the average tfidf score of the term overall

    \caption{Clustering Subreddits using TFIDF Similarity}
    \label{fig:tfidf_similarity}
\end{figure}


analysis was orignally planned with finding datashifts or contradictions bewteen subreddit. For example climate shift vs climate hoax, fake news vs media
seems that subreddits like democrats and conservaties are closer than expected


% todo: consider using tfidf on banned subreddits like the donald and compare?


\subsection{Link Posts and common URLs}

good amount of posts in political subreddits are link posts which only contain a title and a link which often points to a news websites like breitbart, foxnews, dailywire, washingtonpost or social media sites like twitter, reddit itself 

sincce link posts are missing the usual post content, they are a valuable indicator as to what the author is communicating with their post. as such, we need to find a way to add such information as an additional input for predicting popularity


\subsection{Embeddings analysis}


clustered and visualized top posts by popular, controversial and unpopular
used comments for latter 2 as score cant be below 0
seems like clusters can be seen and subreddits seem to have somewhat individual things that are liked, disliked

determine if that is true by training models that try to determine if a post is from a certain subreddit / political subreddit group
used minimum of x score or comments for dataset
compare eval on val set from 2008-2015 vs after

% todo different encoders and prompts

% todo: see which posts were categorized wrongly, what upvote ratio, what was the real vs expected subreddit, etc


\section{Encoder}

looked at Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Leaderboard~\cite{muennighoff2022mteb} for top models

considerations next to performance were hard requirements and first and foremost the embedding dimensions
the lower the better, as encoding millions of posts with different encoders or prompts costs alot of time and takes up alot of memory

for initial analysis we employed the \textit{stella\_en\_400M\_v5} model~\cite{stella_en_400M_v5} as its dimensions could be set to 1024, meaning smaller encoded datasets and maintained a great perofmenace in clustering and classification tasks while having low hardware requirements

during our later tests, additional models joined the leaderboards, so we also compared other encoders with similar requirements, excluding those that we would have had to pay for like gemini-embedding-001 (https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/embeddings) to find the one with the best performance for our use case. the resuls of which encoder performed the best for our task can be seen in the results section

% TODO bender acknowledgement

using the high-performance computing (HPC) environment, specifically the HPC cluster \textit{Bender} at the University of Bonn~\cite{benderhpc}, which provided the necessary computational resources to handle large-scale data processing.


\section{Prompts}

Different prompts for the best encoder model (stella)

no much research whats prompts are best used for social media or political posts specifically

tried to focus on different aspects

% todo show prompts



\section{Gen AI}


Schritte:

1. Generate Posts mit GenAI
multishot prompting to generate text posts with distinct title and text content

2. encode post
encode posts with LLM

3. classify post
see if post is classified as unpopular, popular or controversial
either throw away everything thats not popular or test prediction for those classes too

4. create reddit Post
create post per api
save post id and other information, in case post is deleted, in dataset


SLight alterating to the pipeline, each day flip a coin and if head, we dont throw away unpopular posts and just note the results down
if its tails we classify and throw away if neccessarily
at the end we can see which posts performed better

\subsection{Generating the Post}

first of all we should try to have a consistent persona for the posts
depending on subreddit size, users might recognize the username and if two posts contradict each other
as an example, the post might indicate the user be a woman in one post and a man in another
thereby, they might be detected as written by AI, as there are reddit users that just try to post popular content and generate karma on their account to sell it later
a similar issue is not repeating topics. As it stands, there might be a large amount of posts what will be thrown away. therefore it will be difficult to find enough content that does not repeat itself

% TODO find out what average age and occupation for reddit users is, then use this as a persona
% alternatively change that, depending on age of the respective subreddit from the paper that predicts political leaning too


\subsection{Creating the Post}

problem is the account used to Post
people could look at account and see posts -> make account private
also subreddits have karma minimums and you cant post otherwise or need to be manually reviewed
manual posting using the following prompt to test requirements to post:

Generate a Reddit post. Choose an interesting topic. The post should fit into the subreddit r/truechristian. Make it seem user generated and not like it created by an AI. Give me a Title and Content for the post. Make it suitable for Reddit. Make it seem like a uni student wrote it from the language and sentence structure. Dont use em-dashes.

- Libertarian: post has to be unlocked by moderators (Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/Libertarian.)

upvote ratio verteilung angucken
daten linearisieren

auf range von 0 bis 1 mappen (regreession)

einmal als perzentil zu definieren(10% oder 20% fenster)

Nur die krassesten aha momente in MA
TFIDF bspw offen lassen, ob rein oder nicht
abhängig, ob genug material die arbeit zu füllen


linear regressor (oder anderer der zwischen 0 und 1 mappt, xgboost oder random forrest)
correlations coeffizient (kendal, spearman)
einlesen, was gute Werte sind
in den oberen 10% liegt für post live

upvote ratio irgendwie auf 0 - 1 mappen so dass sinnvoll verteilt ist
große terms sonst auf 1 oder 0 clippen, falls wenige daten ausschlagen
